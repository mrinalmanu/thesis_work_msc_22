				<p>
				International Genetics Literacy and Attitudes Survey – Law: Non Law: Not Students and Ethical
				</p>
				<section>
				<p>
				<small>
				<p>
				iGLAS-LE is an extension of iGLAS. It is a tool developed by TAGC consortium experts <em>(Chapman, 2017)</em> using Qualtrics software for assesing the ethical and Law: Non Law: Not Students aspects of genetic knowledge. Current version is 10.0 with 17 GK questions, across 5 domains. 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
				&ldquo;<em> Understanding people's perceptions and attitudes towards Genetics Science can help us in policymaking. Genetic literacy is about having the sufficient knowledge of genetic principles to make informed decisions in areas of life concerning genetics (Chapman, 2017). And thus, Genetic literacy also becomes a mean of empowerment for individuals (Chapman et al. 2019).
				</em>&rdquo;

				<li> There is an increasing influence of science in socital issues 
				<li> We are embracing a post-genomics era
				<li> Are genetic laws keeping up?
				<li> What do people think about Genetic Rights?
				<li> In this project I looked at 773 Russian participants 
				<li> Divided in 9 kinds of categories
				<li> Categorical divisions were analysed and suitable features were selected
				<li> Using an undirected network approach I summarised relationships of various survey items - <em>e.g.</em> Genetic relatedness with opinions on various likert items
				</ul>

				<ul>
				<li> Gender (Male, Female)
				<li> Age (Old, Young) - Division at mean. We have young participant dominant dataset.
				<li> Students versus non-students - This division was made using variable LE2.060 (University student).
				<li> If students: then Law versus Non-law. And to contrast these students - not students.

				<h3>Likert item opinions</h3>

				<section>
				</br>
				<small>
				We can break these opinions by categorical divisions. Older and high GK participants are the most agreeing ones. Low GK and Law Students have the most varied opinions. But then, non-law students show similar pattern! <b>More people are neutral towards Revising and Updating.</b>

				<small>
				We can look at it more closely using proportions. In this plot the three likert items are grouped together. The proportions should sum to 1, but not every participant is giving their opinion, therefore, the sum is slightly less than 1. <b>Law participants are agreeing but less strongly agreeing!</b>

				Problem 1: How much exactly is the flow for all the items? For example, how much exactly the choice is made by law participants or High Genetic Curious participants. Thus we need a way to visualise seperate flows as well.
				</br>
				Here we have a flow from Revising and Updating to Dissemination of GK. But we also need combinations of every item. This would make for circular and complicated flow diagram. Things become even more difficult when...'

					<b>All paths from a given node</b></br>
					</br>
					<em> Each survey item can be imagined as a node. Assuming that participant can chose 1 option at a given node, then  for the graph with m edges, n nodes, and p paths from the source s to the target t, then for all paths an exhaustive search looks as following</em>
					</br>
					<b>O((np+1)(m+n)) </b></br>
					
					
					</small>
					</br>
					
					<small>
					<ul>
					<li> Since a single very long path can exist in the survey, we may break it down into chunks of two
					<li> At a given time we take the first node, and look at all possible paths to another node
					<li> We count how many time this group of nodes occured throughout the survey
					<li> The resulting graph summarises all interactions (occurences) of any given pair of options

					<ul>
					<em> Additionally, we have two approaches: <b>Permutational</b> and <b>Combinatorial</b>, depending on whether the order is important or not. </em>
					<li> For three likert opinions, I divided the items in permutations of three:
					a.) Policymaking to Revising and Updating; b.) Revising and Updating to Dissemination of GK, and c.) Dissemination of GK to Policymaking
					<li> In second approach: I just took the combinations of three items.
					<li> If we have three items A, B and C. Then we have following combinations:  ['A', 'B'], ['B', 'C'], ['C', 'A']
					<li> All permutations are: ['A', 'B'], ['A', 'C'], ['B', 'A'], ['B', 'C'], ['C', 'A'], ['C', 'B']

					Here is the tabular form of the Permutation method network graph from previous slide.
					</br>
					<small>
					86.58% participants strongly agree to revising and updating. 71.94% strongly agree to policymaking. The strength of connection here is .6228. This is the most salient opinion group in the network of opinions on likert items. Notice that count for the next group of connections is only 33, but it still has a high strength. This implies that almost all of the participants who strongly disagreed to revising and updating, also strongly disagreed to policymaking.

					<em>For the three questions in consideration:</em>
					
					</br>
					<b>1.) What do the participants think about newborn screening decisionmaking responsibility?</b></br>
<em>Younger participants, Students, Low GK confidence and Female participants are the major contributors to survey responses. The biggest connecting node here is 'Two legal guardians need to agree' (upto .374 strength). Compared to this option, second most popular opinion 'Prohibited until child has legal capacity' (upto .235 stength)</em></br>
					<b>2.) Is there a connection with likert opinions and other survey items with newborn screening opinion?</b></br>
<em>Participants from both top options are concerned about misuse of genetic data. 'Two legal guardians need to agree' and 'Prohibited until child has legal capacity' with 'I am concerned that my data will used for other purposes without my knowledge' .313 and .235 strengths respectively.</em></br>
					<b>3.) How are Concerns and Genetic Curiosity items related with each other?</b></br>
<em>Three major shared concerns are genetic data misuse with discrimination (.5 strength) and label for deficiency (.274 strength). These participants agree (strength > .3) or strongly agree (strength > .2) to all three items.</em></br>
<em>For concerns and genetic curiosity, we need to look at the entire network.</em>

					<h3>Significance</h3>
					</br>
					<small>
					<em>We are now able to do the following:</em>
					</small>
				</br>
				<small>
				<ul>
				<li> Derive some measurable variables from existing categorical variables in the survey data, and analyse them.
				<li> Look at the mico-patterns in opinions across a range of items on the survey using clustering methods and visualisation methods.
				<li> Use the categorical divisions to find patterns using network methods.
				<li> Combine different approaches to gain insights from all categorical data.
</br> <em> Similarly, we can ask questions as following: </em>
<li> What are the relative proportions and similarity in the survey, if we have categorical divisions?
For example: Law participants are similar in their responses to low curious participants on some items but not others.
<li> What are the absolute numbers and most important trends in the survey? Most shared versus most prevalent opinions.
For example: Participants are more strongly disagreeing to dissemination of GK than policymaking.
<li> What are the most common paths in the survey?

				</ul>

					<h3>Future Work</h3>
					</br>
					<small>
					<em></em>
					</small>
				</br>
				<small>
				<ul>
				<li> Look at longer patterns by either:
a.) Finding a computationally efficient approach to permutations larger than 2 items. Or, b.) Making groupings for more number of items. For example, instead of just grouping with Genetic Curiosity, we can collapse the nodes for longer paths. Such as Genetic Curioisty + Level of Concern + Participant Group.

<li> How can we describe the defined parameter 'Strength' in a leniar space? Understanding this can help us answer more complex questions, for example, if participants agree to something, and they also belong to a particular categorical division, how their opinions change for another survey item.
				</ul>

				</small>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</br>
					<small>
					<em></em>
					</small>
				</br>
				<small>
				<ul>
				<li> Studying patterns in survey data can help us with policymaking. Thus, in effect, it is for the empowerment of individuals.
<li> We can divide the survey in various categorical divisions, as well as derive some continuous variables.
<li> We can find important trends and look at survey data as a whole using Network methods.
<li> Combining Network methods with clustering and visualisations are a powerful tool to understand the structure of the survey responses as well as participant profiles.
<li> iGLAS-LE addresses difficult ethical and legal issues in Genetics, and highlights the Concerns of participants regarding Genetic Rights.
				</ul>
