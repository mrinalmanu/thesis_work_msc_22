# thesis_work_msc_22

This is the frozen project repository for my MSc Thesis Work. The field of work is Computational Humanities. Due to NDA, I have only provided the html outputs, and Jupyter Notebooks. The data, data dictionaries and results folders are not uploaded completely except for results relvant to thesis.These results can be viewed from presentation folder. I will keep posting the articles associated with this work in this repository. 

To view the presentation, you can download the folder and launch 'presentation_Mrinal.html'. Pressing Escape key will show an overview of the presentation. This is an exhaustive presentation version. Actual delievered presentation differs based on the audience. :)
