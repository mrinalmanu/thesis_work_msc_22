# thesis_work_msc_22

This is the frozen project repository for my MSc Thesis Work. The field of work is Computational Humanities. Due to NDA, I have only provided the html outputs, and Jupyter Notebooks. The data, data dictionaries and results folders are not uploaded. However, the results can be viewed from presentation folder. I have also omitted the exhaustive list of results. All of which can be accessed as journal articles will be published. I will keep posting the articles associated with this work in this repository. 

To view the presentation, you can download the folder and launch 'presentation_Mrinal.html'. Pressing Escape key will show an overview of the presentation. This is an exhaustive presentation version. Actual delievered presentation will differ based on audience.
